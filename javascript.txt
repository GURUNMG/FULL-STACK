console.log() it used to print the statemets inside it
like string, int, float, double

like python we can create a variable in same data type

once we declared a variable using var we can redeclare it using the 
var with same variable name

but if we declared the variable with "let" we cannot redeclare it with same variable name

const once we declared a variable we cannot redeclare it and we cannot re-assign the variable
g=0
const g=9
console.log(g) => it will give error

we can re assign the variable with any data type to other data type
PREFERABLE DECLARATION IS "let"

In javascript number is stored as 64 bit

TYPES OF DATA TYPES:
1. Boolean => a=true  (true, false)
2. String => a="GURUBHARAN N M"
3. Object => a={name:"GURUBHARAN N M",age:20, dep:"CSE"}
to access the specific key => a.name will give GURUBHARN N M will be printed
4. Array can hold any data type, no need of having a specific memory size
to add the element at the end of an Array we need to use push() function

example: a=[1,2,3,4,5]

let a=[1,2,3,4,5,6];
a.push(55);
console.log(a);

IF ELSE (==) does not consider the data type of the left and right
but (===) considers the data type of the left ans right

FUNCTIONS:


ARROW FUNCTIONS
const sum=(user)=>{
  console.log(user);
}

a={
  name:"GURUBHARAN N M",
  age:18,
  dep:"CSE"
}
sum(a.name);

REPL =>
R => READ
E => EVALUATE 
P => PRINT
L => LOOP

class and constructor ... parameterized constructor
class Color
{
  constructor(name, code)
  {
    this.name=name;
    this.code=code;
  }
}

let blackColor=new Color("black","#000000");
console.log(blackColor);
